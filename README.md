# Swigscripts
Scripts for portswigger web academy answers. Used as an example of using scripting languages rather than commercial tools.

This should not be used to cheat for the answers otherwise you would just be wasting your time. The value in this comes from reading the scripts rather than using them though I highly recommend you write your own.
